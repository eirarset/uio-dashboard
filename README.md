## UiO dashboard
An react-app that lets students add their courses at UiO, and get their lecture schedule as well as the weather/temperature for the next five days.

The UiO data is fetched from the [UiO API](https://data.uio.no/studies/v1/). 

The weather information is fetched from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
